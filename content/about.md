### Life stuff I've done

### Tech stuff I've done

### Tech things I've used
- Operating systems:
  - I use [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/intro) and love it.
  - Within Qubes I use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) as well as [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/).
  - Extra fun things Qubes lets me do:
    - [Split-ssh](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/configuration/split-ssh.md)
    - [Split-gpg](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/)
    - [Opening URLs in Disposable VMs](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/common-tasks/opening-urls-in-vms.md)
    - [Unikernel-based Firewall](https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall)
  - For mobile OS, I use [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org)
- Software:
  - Web Browsing:
    - I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) with [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) cause damn is the web terrible without an ad-blocker.
  - Communication tools:
    - I have used both [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) and [Protonmail](https://proton.me/mail) for email
    - [Signal](https://signal.org)
    - I use [Hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/) for IRC (rarely)
    - I (reluctantly) have been known to use Discord from time-to-time.
  - Office apps I like:
    - [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) gets the job done
    - I was recently using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), it seems great!
    - I have also used Xournal, Featherpad, GIMP, VLC, Mirage
  - Authentication/Security:
    - Use an offline password manager! Ideally in an offline VM. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)
    - [Veracrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) is cool for storing information in less-trusted environments.
    - I use [OTPClient](https://github.com/paolostivanin/OTPClient) in an offline VM for TOTP codes.
  - Dev tools:
    - I do most of my writing, code or text, in `nano` (like this document, proudly written in nano)
    - For times when that proves too frustrating, I've also used [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)
    - [GParted](https://gparted.org/) is awesome
  - For downloading and viewing things:
    - [Kiwix](https://www.kiwix.org/en/) for viewing things
    - [Zimit](https://github.com/openzim/zimit) for downloading stuff for Kiwix
    - The iconic [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/)
  - Hosting + Domains:
    - [Njalla](https://njal.la)
  - VPN:
    - Step 1, consider if you actually need a VPN and what you're using it for. Hint: you probably don't need it for what you're thinking of.
    - I like the looks of Njalla, Mullvad, and iVPN.

### Tech stuff I want to learn more about

- Matrix (Element)
- Scuttlebutt
- IPFS
