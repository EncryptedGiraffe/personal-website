[Could humans really destroy all life on earth?](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210520-could-humans-really-destroy-all-life-on-earth), 
[Humans exploiting and destroying nature on unprecedented scale](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/10/humans-exploiting-and-destroying-nature-on-unprecedented-scale-report-aoe),
[A looming mass extinction caused by humans](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20121101-a-looming-mass-extinction).

The news loves it, people think about it, maybe some of us even talk about it. Are humans just plain evil? From one perspective, it's easy to think so.
There's countless examples of how our species seems to fuck up everything we touch.

We destroy the environment, wipe out other species, pollute the oceans, commit genocide, murder, and assault. We're greedy, corrupt, and can't seem to look out for anyone but ourselves.
There certainly would be plenty of available evidence to create a solid empirical case of the evilness of humanity.

However, I don't believe this is a question that actually has a definitive answer. Humans are clearly capable of great evil, yet we can also be very kind and compassionate beings.

In the end, it comes down to perspective. Everybody for themselves decides an answer to this question. And maybe we don't consciously think about it.
But on some level, I think most people have at least considered it.

This post is not about proving either side, I have my own opinions, but as I said, I don't believe there is a single answer to this question.

What I want to talk about is what it does to your life, your worldview, when you hold either end of this debate as a belief.

I used to be involved in a couple youth activist groups, working on environmental and social justice issues.
There, I found a certainly common opinion as to the negative presence of humans. I get it, working while surrounded by discourse and news about how humans are causing climate change, destroying ecosystems, polluting the planet, all while our supposed leaders ignore or hamper any effort to change?
There started to become a level of acceptance, of expectation. We expected to be disappointed, we prepared for everything to get worse.
The nature of that movement is of a constant struggle, a fight against the stupid, complicit masses of people who just don't seem to get it.

I started to hear the sentiment "well they're all just evil, really we're all complicit in these systems."
Then with COVID, "hah, the virus was sent by the Earth to kill all humans to protect itself" and "if the virus kills us all at least everything else will be better."

I personally think this is really sad to see. These were people, as young as 14 or 15, who believed that the world would be better off without our species.

My big question here is what does that do to someone? If they actually believe that the world would be better off without them? Without everyone they know?
On the extreme side of that, if one truly thinks that if all humans died the Earth would prosper, what else would they believe?
Well naturally, if they care for the planet, and their existence harms it, then they are bad.
As a fundamentally evil being, their life causes harm, their every action will cause destruction, everything they do, bad.
That means simply by living they are causing harm, their existence is inherently bad. That means everything they say, every action they take, bad.

It means no matter how hard they try, they will always fail to do any good because they are just bad. Bad, evil, destructive people.

What does that do to someone? If everything you do is bad, would you do anything? If everything you try will fail, why try?
Why try to improve things, or change the world, if everything you do will still be bad? If you believe that they best possible action you could take would be to die.

Now, the above is the perspective taken to the extreme, but it doesn't have to be. I find in my own experience that varying levels of that belief pervade our culture.
It's popular within jokes, self-deprecating humor with the punchline being all of us. Jokes and humor are consistently used by people to mention things they aren't willing to discuss outright.
I often say that a lot of jokes, particularly self-deprecating ones, have an amount of truth behind them. People joke about what makes them uncomfortable.
And being thought of as evil is certainly uncomfortable.

Perspective matters. And that's my question here. Everyone will have their own perspective on the moral goodness of humanity, but I worry that having a cultural element of thinking of humans only as destroyers may become a self-fulling prophecy.

Guilt, apathy, helplessness. All emotions we see tied to the worldly crises. All emotions that would come from feeling that even your attempts to help would just hurt.

My personal perspective on the matter is that humans are capable of both great destruction and great creation. We're incredibly effective at creating change.
Change can be both positive and negative. Just because we have caused so much harm does not mean we are incapable of doing good.
But once again, this is unprovable. However, an attitude change, a perspective chamge, may make great strides in people starting to see themselves and their actions differently.
I think we can do great things, [heal some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI) [of the](http://inhabitfilm.com/) [damage we've caused](https://www.greeningthedesertproject.org/about-us/). But in order to do so we need to believe that we can.

To close, a quote from Robin Wall Kimmerer:
> “Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond.”
