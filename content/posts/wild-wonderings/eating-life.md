and yes, i eat pigs, while also acknowledging their intelligence, and the value of their life. i marvel almost every day at how smart, gentle, and loving pigs are. i absolutely adore them. but i eat them. you see, as an animal, i am unable to photosynthesize directly from the sun, so thus in order to live, I must always involve death. something must die for me to live, whether it be plants, or animals, etc.
now, many people draw a huge ethical distinction between killing a plant for food and killing an animal for food. i reject that.
a lot of people justify that be saying animals are much more intelligent than plants, so that makes it wrong. i disagree, i think plants are our oldest teachers, and possess a much grander intelligence than most people believe, just because they can't do math or do tricks doesn't mean they're stupid. everyday, simply by existing, a plant does a multitude of things I will never be able to.
plants lack language to tell us their stories, so instead their entire existence becomes their story, their lives a dance to teach us about the world.
I think both plants and animals (and fungi) are incredibly sacred, and hold immeasurable value as living beings. however, i kill and eat them.
part of this i think, is that i do not view death as the ultimate horror, the worst possible outcome, that much of our society does. death is simply another part of life, it's continuance if you will. from life comes death and from death comes life. so much of our modern world is structured around avoiding death at all costs. in our medical system, people are regularly (though this is changing recently some places) kept alive past when they want to be, often in great suffering. this is because people view death as the ultimate calamity. if a non-human animal is suffering, like a sick or injured pet, most people agree the right thing to do is put it down to end it's suffering, however we do the complete opposite for humans. i think this is hugely unhelpful to ourselves, and a more healthy relationship with death i believe is an integral part of any well-functioning society.
furthermore, personally, ethically speaking, i think the way our food is grown/raised and then prepared is incredibly important. factory farmed meat is disgusting both literally and ethically. and yet also so is conventional agriculture, vast fields, hundreds of acres, of just corn, or soybeans, or wheat. both are an affront to the land and the life it supports, and a disgrace to the sacred nature of plants and animals.
but when I grow my own food, or raise animals, i know that they've had good lives. they had space to live, whether to graze or to reach for the sun. they were loved, and lived in a way in balance with the world, in environments they were meant to be in. i will always maintain that plants are better and healthier in diverse polycultures, forming their relationships with the ground, the wind, and the sky. same goes for animals, able to do what they evolved to do, whether that be rooting and mucking around, or grazing through fields and forest.
that's the kind of food i want to eat, the kind of food i want to create. and far from being unethical, i see it as incredibly special and sacred that i'm able to take part it that.
