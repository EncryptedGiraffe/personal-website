Hi there!
Here I will share anything I think is interesting. It might be random information, books, or videos, or articles, or quotes, anything of the sort. 
This page will (presumably) expand over time.

Interesting quote:

> A civilization which leaves so large a number of its participants unsatisfied and drives them into revolt neither has nor deserves the prospect of a lasting existence.
> \- Sigmund Freud

### Writing
I've always enjoyed writing, and trying to express ideas using it. When voices quiet, words persist. When memories fade, words remain clear.
Words represent thoughts cast into the physical, a memoir of our lives. Words contain our history, our present, and countless futures.  

That's why burning books is associated with totalitarian regimes, they seek to destroy knowledge to cement their power. 
Now clearly, words are not the only means to convey ideas or preserve knowledge. Many cultures around the world had success using verbal or pictoral histories.  

However, words are special in this age because are extraordinarily easy to transmit across the globe, to reach people who would never otherwise cross paths with me.
And yet also because of this, anyone and everyone has something to say, it's difficult to know who to believe, and who is trying to mislead you.  

Our collective trust in journalism and the news is being eroded, as everyone puts their own spin on things, and the news sells current events for profit.  
 
We find that truth is subjective and seemingly unknowable, that there may not be one "true objective reality."  

I think there's only one way to go on in a world where objectivity and truth is crumbling.  

**With our stories.**  

We'll find each other in our stories. Our subjectively true, our biased, our authentic, our joyful and painful, stories.  
We'll write our own stories, plotting our course through life.  

There's an undeniable truth within each and everyone of us. We'll find it in ourselves and we'll find it in each other.  

Whatever your chosen medium is, use it to share your story. Write, paint, sing, dance, sketch, compose, grow. Whatever it is, put your soul into it.  
Express yourself and show the world who you are.  

For some time I thought the best way to change the world was to reach the entire world. To become famous, to get a platform.
To get access to the shining spotlight to get a message to everyone. If only we could just get people to *listen*, then everything would be better.  

Turns out, that's super naive and not how people actually work.  

I now think that one of the most important things you can do to change the world is just being authentic.  

Just being *yourself*.  

You know, authenticity, the thing that our world makes so hard to find.  

> This whole time I thought changing the world was something you did. An act you performed, something you fought for, I don't know if that's true anymore, or if changing the world was just about being here. By showing up, no matter how many times we get told we don't belong. By staying true even when we're shamed into being false. By believing in ourselves, even when we are told we're too different. And if we all held onto that. If we refused to budge and fall in line. If we stood our ground for long enough, just maybe, the world can't help but change around us.
> \- Mr Robot

By sharing my stories, thoughts, mistakes, and lessons, you might find one of your own stories in mine.  
Now, my tiny handful of experiences, the things I've learned, aren't going to change the whole world, but that's not the point.
They changed me, and they could change you.  

> But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you. With all my heart, I love you.
> \- V for Vendetta

### More quotes

> I think most kids have a sense that it's not supposed to be this way. You're not supposed to hate Monday, or be happy when you don't have to go to school. School should be something that you love. Life should be something that you love.
> \- Charles Eisenstein

> Food is life, and life must not step away from nature.
> \- Masanobu Fukuoka, The One-Straw Revolution

> You can solve all the world's problems in a garden.
> \- Geoff Lawton

> Though the problems of the world are increasingly complex, the solutions remain embarrassingly simple.
> \- Bill Mollison

  - Within Qubes I use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) as well as [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/).
  - Extra fun things Qubes lets me do:
    - [Split-ssh](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/configuration/split-ssh.md)
    - [Split-gpg](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/)
    - [Opening URLs in Disposable VMs](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/common-tasks/opening-urls-in-vms.md)
    - [Unikernel-based Firewall](https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall)
- Software:
  - Web Browsing:
    - I like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) with [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) cause damn is the web terrible without an ad-blocker.
  - Communication tools:
    - I have used both [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) and [Protonmail](https://proton.me/mail) for email

    - Use an offline password manager! Ideally in an offline VM. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)

    - I use [OTPClient](https://github.com/paolostivanin/OTPClient) in an offline VM for TOTP codes.
  - Dev tools:
    - I do most of my writing, code or text, in `nano` (like this document, proudly written in nano)
    - For times when that proves too frustrating, I've also used [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)
    - [GParted](https://gparted.org/) is awesome
