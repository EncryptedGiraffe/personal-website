<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed writing, and trying to express ideas using it. When voices quiet, words persist. When memories fade, words remain clear.
Words represent thoughts cast into the physical, a memoir of our lives. Words contain our history, our present, and countless futures.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why burning books is associated with totalitarian regimes, they seek to destroy knowledge to cement their power.
Now clearly, words are not the only means to convey ideas or preserve knowledge. Many cultures around the world had success using verbal or pictoral histories.</p>
<p>However, words are special in this age because are extraordinarily easy to transmit across the globe, to reach people who would never otherwise cross paths with me.
And yet also because of this, anyone and everyone has something to say, it&rsquo;s difficult to know who to believe, and who is trying to mislead you.</p>
<p>Our collective trust in journalism and the news is being eroded, as everyone puts their own spin on things, and the news sells current events for profit.</p>
<p>We find that truth is subjective and seemingly unknowable, that there may not be one &ldquo;true objective reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s only one way to go on in a world where objectivity and truth is crumbling.</p>
<p><strong>With our stories.</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find each other in our stories. Our subjectively true, our biased, our authentic, our joyful and painful, stories.
We&rsquo;ll write our own stories, plotting our course through life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an undeniable truth within each and everyone of us. We&rsquo;ll find it in ourselves and we&rsquo;ll find it in each other.</p>
<p>Whatever your chosen medium is, use it to share your story. Write, paint, sing, dance, sketch, compose, grow. Whatever it is, put your soul into it.</p>
<p>Express yourself and show the world who you are.</p>
<p>For some time I thought the best way to change the world was to reach the entire world. To become famous, to get a platform.
To get access to the shining spotlight to get a message to everyone. If only we could just get people to <em>listen</em>, then everything would be better.</p>
<p>Turns out, that&rsquo;s super naive and not how people actually work.</p>
<p>I now think that one of the most important things you can do to change the world is just being authentic.</p>
<p>Just being <em>yourself</em>.</p>
<p>You know, authenticity, the thing that our world makes so hard to find.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This whole time I thought changing the world was something you did. An act you performed, something you fought for, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true anymore, or if changing the world was just about being here. By showing up, no matter how many times we get told we don&rsquo;t belong. By staying true even when we&rsquo;re shamed into being false. By believing in ourselves, even when we are told we&rsquo;re too different. And if we all held onto that. If we refused to budge and fall in line. If we stood our ground for long enough, just maybe, the world can&rsquo;t help but change around us.
- Mr Robot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to be here for it all. The best experiences and the ugly ones, the joys and the sorrows. I want us all to tell stories of the times when we failed.
I want to cheer when others succeed, and have them cheer when I do.</p>
<p>I want us to be honest, in our most vulnerable of moments. When we&rsquo;re challenged, but we stand strong.</p>
<p>I want the real stories of our lives, what really matters to us.</p>
<p>Because you see, we&rsquo;ve all grown much too talented at creating false worlds, elaborate systems we invent and then pretend were always there.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start telling stories instead.</p>
<p>By sharing my stories, thoughts, mistakes, and lessons, you might find one of your own stories in mine.
Now, my tiny handful of experiences, the things I&rsquo;ve learned, aren&rsquo;t going to change the whole world, but that&rsquo;s not the point.
They changed me, and they could change you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you. I love you. With all my heart, I love you.

<h3 id="truth">Truth</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in objective truth.</p>
<p>To put it another way, I don&rsquo;t believe that every question has a universally &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer. I don&rsquo;t believe that in an argument or dispute, one must be wrong while the other right.
I don&rsquo;t think everyone experiences the world the same, nor does there exist a &ldquo;true objective frame of reference&rdquo; upon which all else is based.</p>
<p>When people are involved, there are always many different stories about a given event, and even if they conflict, I don&rsquo;t think that forces one or more of them to be wrong.<br>
Each person&rsquo;s story is true to them, so thus has a certain truth to it.</p>
<p>This for me invalidates the idea of universal objective morality.</p>
<p>Any action can be seen as moral or immoral as according to people, and they&rsquo;re all right. People can (and will) disagree about morality all the time.
However, the only thing morality can affect is your own actions. Essentially, what will you stand for?</p>
<p>If someone defers their morality to an external source, religion for example, that structure simply becomes a part of their own moral beliefs.<br>
I reject the idea that any religion or belief system is &ldquo;universally correct&rdquo; above all others.</p>
<p>The purpose of morality is to decide what we are okay with, and what we&rsquo;re willing to do about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tis the choices we make - me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This belief has a lot of implications for just about everything else that I believe, as I mention throughout the rest of my writing.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>Copyright, patents, and more broadly, intellectual property is nonsensical, contradictory, and antithetical to its original aims.
Ideas, inventions, and creations never exist in isolation, all ideas come from a basis of pre-existing knowledge.</p>
<p>Intellectual property disproportionally benefits the last person in the chain of ideas and knowledge that produced an idea. All invention is social.</p>
<p>Additionally, copyright often now doesn&rsquo;t even serve the interests of creators, the supposed reason for its existence.
Instead, publishers reap immense profit off the creative works of others.</p>
<p>Freely available information and knowledge is a benefit to the whole world, attempts to restrict that access should be resisted and undermined.</p>

<h3 id="property-and-possession">Property and Possession</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Possession&rdquo; is rooted in the concept of &ldquo;use rights&rdquo; while &ldquo;private property&rdquo; is rooted in a separation between the users and ownership.
As example, a house that someone lives in is a possession, whereas if they rented it to someone else to make profit, it becomes property.</p>
<p>Similarly, if someone uses a set of tools to make a living as a self-employed carpenter, those tools are their possessions.
However, if they instead pay other people to use those tools to generate profit for them, the tools are property.</p>
<p>This distinction may be confusing at first, but it is interesting to think about with respect to our society.
A lot of people use the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; to refer to everything from their toothbrush to their $2.9 million house in Vegas that they rent out.
Those two things clearly have a very different impact on their lives, and society in general.</p>
<p>And now, an iconic quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Property is theft</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A story:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once, somewhere, there were two people. One of them was a very busy person, always running around doing things.
You see, they were in the business of buying and selling stars. They&rsquo;d be making high-stakes trades all day, doing deals to amasse more stars.
Eventually, after much great work, they owned thousands of stars. However, they constantly had to work to own more and more stars.
It is the nature of star-owners to need ever-more stars to own.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other person lived a much more quiet life. They owned no stars, in fact had only two possessions: a small flowering plant, and a nearby volcano.
Every day, they watered their plant if it was dry, and cleaned out their volcano.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, the busy person was rushing by, when they came upon a person cleaning a volcano. &ldquo;Oh wow, how poor this person is, who owns no stars and must clean this volcano.&rdquo;
In an act of charitable kindness (that would also save them stars in tax benefits) they offered to gift a couple of stars to this poor person, out of pity for their life.
The volcano cleaner, gently refusing the offer, pulled out a plant and showed it to the other person.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you who does so much and owns so many stars, are you happy with your life? Have you done good in this world?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You see, I own only this plant and this volcano, and every day I water the plant and clean this volcano.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;The plant is happy and thriving, and the volcano is nice and clean. My possessions benefit from me having owned them.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;But the stars that you own, are they better because you own them? Is the world improved by it?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d say there are probably infinite different ways that story could end, but there&rsquo;s one that I find interesting.</p>
<p>The rich person laughs at the other, mocking them for clearly not understanding how the world works.<br>
They go on with their life, getting more and more stars to own. Maybe sometime, but possibly never, a little nagging voice takes hold in the back of their head.<br>
&ldquo;Why do I need so many more stars, maybe wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to improve the things I own, instead of just needing more?&rdquo;<br>
Perhaps they change, make different choices.</p>
<p>I think this speaks to how people on some level recognize truths when they see them, even if they aren&rsquo;t ready to consciously know that yet.</p>
<p><strong>Land:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I am evicted from one piece of private property, where can I go? Nowhere, unless another owner agrees to allow me access to their piece of private property.
This means that everywhere I can stand is a place where I have no right to stand without permission and, as a consequence,
I exist only by the sufferance of the property owning elite.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The land monopoly consists of enforcement by government of land titles which do not rest upon personal occupancy and use. It also includes making the squatting of abandoned housing and other forms of property illegal. This leads to ground-rent, by which landlords get payment for letting others use the land they own but do not actually cultivate or use. It also allows the ownership and control of natural resources like oil, gas, coal and timber. This monopoly is particularly exploitative as the owner cannot claim to have created the land or its resources. It was available to all until the landlord claimed it by fencing it off and barring others from using it.<br>
Until the nineteenth century, the control of land was probably the single most important form of privilege by which working people were forced to accept less than its product as a wage. While this monopoly is less important in a modern capitalist society (as few people know how to farm), it still plays a role (particularly in terms of ownership of natural resources). At a minimum, every home and workplace needs land on which to be built. Thus while cultivation of land has become less important, the use of land remains crucial. The land monopoly, therefore, ensures that working people find no land to cultivate, no space to set up shop and no place to sleep without first having to pay a landlord a sum for the privilege of setting foot on the land they own but neither created nor use. At best, the worker has mortgaged their life for decades to get their wee bit of soil or, at worse, paid their rent and remained as property-less as before. Either way, the landlords are richer for the exchange.</p>

<p>Though the problems of the world are increasingly complex, the solutions remain embarrassingly simple.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest change we need to make is from consumption to production, even if on a small scale, in our own gardens. If only 10% of us do this, there is enough for everyone. Hence the futility of revolutionaries who have no gardens, who depend on the very system they attack, and who produce words and bullets, not food and shelter.
