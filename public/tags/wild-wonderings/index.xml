      <description>Could humans really destroy all life on earth?, Humans exploiting and destroying nature on unprecedented scale, A looming mass extinction caused by humans.
The news loves it, people think about it, maybe some of us even talk about it. Are humans just plain evil? From one perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to think so. There&amp;rsquo;s countless examples of how our species seems to fuck up everything we touch.

      <description>hello world
I would say that nearly every programmer in the world has written a so-called &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; program at some point in their journey.
This program, once launched, prints &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; to the screen and then exits. A very simple goal, but the countless ways to write such a program is a testament to the myriad of techniques and languages programmers use.
Diving a little deeper though, we see that underneath such a simple program, an immense amount of work is being done.</description>
